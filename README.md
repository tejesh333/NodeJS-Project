# NodeJS-Project
“Indian Agro Services” is a collaborative platform for all the account holders (Farmers) to get use of many sessions hosted by other users on different farming techniques.

This application will allow farmers to select a connection (session hosted by a user) and can add it to his profile so that he can attend to the session to gain knowledge on that topic.

He can also add a new connection (host a new session on a farming topic) so that other users can add it to their profile to attend to.
